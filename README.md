# PBImageDownloader
Small script to download hi-res versions of photos posted on pinkbike.com
Script will prompt for URL, provide a standard pinkbike image link (ie https://www.pinkbike.com/photo/21694027/).
If there is a hi-res version of the image it will be downloaded, there a few constraints and edge cases where 
images cannot be downloaded (any image before about 2006) or do not have a hi-res version.
